        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add tortellini, stir, and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until tortellini float to the surface and the filling is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>While the tortellini is cooking, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in heavy cream and chicken broth; mix well and simmer for 5 minutes, making sure not to boil. Add Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, white wine, garlic, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Toss drained tortellini and chicken together in an ungreased 11x17-inch casserole dish. Pour Alfredo sauce over top, then cover with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.</li>
